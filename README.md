## 📖 Description

Gorillas is a remake of the classic QBasic Gorillas game that came with MS-DOS. Players control gorillas positioned on buildings in a city skyline. The goal is to hit your opponent by throwing explosives (bananas) by controlling the angle and velocity of your throw.

## ✨ Features

- Colorful city skyline with dynamic buildings
- Physics-based projectile motion
- Single player mode with AI opponent
- Two player mode for local multiplayer
- Blast holes that damage buildings
- Sound effects and background music
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## 🎯 How to Play

1. The game starts with Player 1's turn (left gorilla)
2. Click and drag from the banana to set your throw angle and velocity
   - The further you drag, the more powerful the throw
   - The direction determines the angle
3. Release to throw the banana
4. Watch as the banana follows its trajectory
5. If you miss, it becomes the other player's turn
6. First player to hit the opposing gorilla wins!
