Defer
-If you stop and build a little door every time you find one in the instructions, it takes longer to finish the whole house. That’s like a normal script—stopping everything to run right away.
-But if you collect all the doors first and attach them after finishing the house, it's much faster. That’s like using defer—the script waits until the whole page is ready before running.
